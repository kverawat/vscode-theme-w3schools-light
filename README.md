## Inconsistencies?

If you find any inconsistency in any language, raise an Issue and I'll fix it, please provide a sample for the language so I can compare. 

**Attention:** If you are using **VSCode 1.43.0**, you must be seeing very different colors, as reported [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/92308). An update to VSCode will be released fixing this issue for all themes, in the meantime, make sure you set this in your settings:

```json
"editor.semanticHighlighting.enabled": false
```

## Customization

If you are using VSCode 1.12+ versions you can customize the colors to your liking, overriding the ones provided by this theme. More info [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/theme-color-reference).

### Custom Font

The original w3schools Light Theme does not use a custom font, for that reason I don't supply a custom font either, but you might be using the [Fira Mono](https://github.com/mozilla/Fira) font. You can easily [customize your settings](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/settings) to use it.  
If you download and install the font in your system, you can add this option to have a custom font:

```json
{
    "editor.fontFamily": "YOUR FONT, Menlo, Monaco, 'Courier New', monospace"
}
```
